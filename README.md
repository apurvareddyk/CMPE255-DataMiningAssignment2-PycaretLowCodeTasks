# CMPE255 Data Mining Assignment 2: PyCaret Low Code Tasks

This repository contains the implementation of various data mining tasks using PyCaret, a low-code machine learning library in Python. The project is part of the CMPE255 Data Mining course assignment.

## Project Overview

This assignment demonstrates the use of PyCaret for different data mining and machine learning tasks. PyCaret's low-code approach enables rapid model development and comparison, showcasing its efficiency in handling various data mining problems.

## Tasks Implemented

1. **Classification**: Predicting categorical outcomes using supervised learning techniques.
2. **Regression**: Estimating continuous values based on input features.
3. **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points without predefined labels.
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in the dataset.
5. **Association Rules Mining**: Discovering interesting relations between variables.
6. **Time Series Forecasting**: Predicting future values based on historical time-series data. Main difference between Univariate Time Series Forecasting without Exogenous Variables and Univariate Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables lies in the inclusion (or exclusion) of external factors or additional variables that might influence the time series predictions.

Each task is implemented using PyCaret's streamlined workflow, highlighting the library's versatility and ease of use.
